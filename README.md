# Setup-2022
Day -22 in preparation of the new year

## Projects
First point of interest, is that the projects panel seems to be geared to team collaborations. Without having a programming buddy to team with, learning this content may be an exercise in futility, as I will have to have a small psychotic episode and start coding with myself... While _Solo Synchronization_ can be highly entertaining, I don't see much benefit in that particular track... 

On the other hand... For a large application, with many moving parts, each being a seperate concern... Or for multiple concerns (say, the web trinity [ a | b | c ] )It __COULD__ be handy to have each one seperate yet linked... I feel like the psychotic break has just kicked in... Back off... Return after dinner.
