# Setup-2022
Day -22 in preparation of the new year

## Projects
First point of interest, is that the projects panel seems to be geared to team collaborations. Without having a programming buddy to team with, learning this content may be an exercise in futility, as I will have to have a small psychotic episode and start coding with myself... While _Solo Synchronization_ can be highly entertaining, I don't see much benefit in that particular track... 

On the other hand... For a large application, with many moving parts, each being a seperate concern... Or for multiple concerns (say, the web trinity [ a | b | c ] )It __COULD__ be handy to have each one seperate yet linked... I feel like the psychotic break has just kicked in... Back off... Return after dinner.

One of my daily tasks, at least for a while, is to collect ideas. the ideas will simply be thrown into a review period in the project, and at the end of that period, we will either add them to a next week target, or pass them into the next week review period. This will create, very quickly I imagine, quite a lot of tasks to get done, not all of which will I have the actual inclination to finish, or even maybe start, after we begin to gain momentum.

One of my tasks is to port this coallation project onto a private (?) server also. Not that anything is private these days.
